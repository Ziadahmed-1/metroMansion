        Our Story

      <Typography sx={{ typography: { xs: "body1", md: "h5" } }}>
        MetroMansion was founded in 2023 by a group of real estate enthusiasts
        and tech innovators who saw the need for a more transparent and
        efficient way to navigate the property market. With years of combined
        experience in the real estate and technology sectors, our founders set
        out to create a platform that would simplify the process for everyone
        involved.
